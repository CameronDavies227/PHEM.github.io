23.	Confirm how icons chosen for each input are relevant to the type of input being sought.
The smiling face of the first name icon covers the way people mostly interact while the lastname is for more formal interactions as signified by the signiture icon the phone and mail are of course standered ways of denoting a phone number and email.

24.	What is it that you are trying to convey in the logo design created
Mostly applying the designs suggested in the pitch notes as possible with a few changes to make more sense for the design. The desktop logo is to small for the smaller text and the mobile logo really needs it for clarity but the circle dosen't really work.

25.	What WHS principles were followed while working on this project
ergonomic seating and taking regular breaks.
